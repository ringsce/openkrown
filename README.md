## openkrown Engine

This is an open source engine for iOS and macOS. It relies on Xcode 13+, iOS 15+ and Big Sur+ 

# Which is the purpose to do another engine?
There are so many engines but for me I don't have any kind of engine to build my own RPG or CCG games.
Today, I want to deliver an engine as a learning purpose.
Here, you will see UI coded with swift. The engine will ahve a static library way. With these libraries you can code by your own games.
On this GitHub you will find an IDE called RingsCE, for the coding. For now, is a proof of concept. We are coding the swift UI for RingsCE.
We are learners also as you, we are learning how to build custom UI, C++ openGL, vulkan for the gaming shadows.
Remember, these project is a proof of concept for now.
